# VFS Global – Operational Risk & SLA Analytics Framework

## Project Objective
To analyze operational data from visa application processing and identify
SLA breaches, workload imbalances, and risk hotspots using structured analytics.

## Business Context
Visa processing operations are time-sensitive and compliance-driven.
Delays, rework, or escalations can impact customer experience and regulatory risk.
This project simulates how operational data can be used to monitor and mitigate such risks.

## Key Questions
- Where do SLA breaches occur most frequently?
- Which visa types and centers carry higher operational risk?
- Is delay driven by volume or processing inefficiency?
- What early signals predict escalation or rework?

## Tools Used
- SQL (metric logic and aggregation)
- Excel / CSV (data structuring)
- Power BI (dashboarding – planned)

## Status
🚧 In progress – data modeling and KPI design
